# Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases

We calculate the synthetic mutual gauge field cooperated by microwave shielding and dipolar interaction in polar molecular gases. The codes are written in Mathematica 14.

Calculation Scripts

1.We calculate the synthetic magnetic field is shown in fig3a.nb.
2.We calculate the total magnetic flux across the equator in the regime outside of the shielding core is shown in fig3b.nb.
