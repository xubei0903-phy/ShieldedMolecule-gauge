# Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases

We calculate the synthetic mutual gauge field cooperated by microwave shielding and dipolar interaction in polar molecular gases. The codes are written by Bei Xu in Mathematica 14 and Fan Yang in Python.

Calculation Scripts

1.We calculate the synthetic magnetic field in fig3a.nb.
2.We calculate the total magnetic flux across the equator in the regime outside of the shielding core in fig3b.nb.
3.We calculate the angular momentum of the ground state of the two microwave-shielded molecules in a harmonic trap in ShieldedMolecule-Lz.py

Usage
Place the pack folder and ShieldedMolecule-Lz.py in the same directory.

Data
The data from 'data.txt' is responsible for generating Fig-4.png.
